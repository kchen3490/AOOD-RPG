# AOOD-RPG

Welcome to AOOD-RPG by Weijie Ye and Kai Chen!

It is a mouse-based clicking application we created for our Java-based computer science class on advanced object oriented design.

To run the application, please visit https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk18-archive-downloads.html and download the Java SE Development Kit 18.0.1.1 on whichever OS you're on.

Once you have the JDK, Resources folder, and the exe file downloaded, we hope you enjoy!
